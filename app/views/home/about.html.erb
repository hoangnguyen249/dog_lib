<p>The data I am planning to use is sourced from the Dog API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/). This API provides access to a vast collection of dog images and related information.
The data from the Dog API is structured in a JSON format. The main endpoint of the API provides a list of dog breeds along with their sub-breeds. Each breed or sub-breed has an associated list of image URLs.
To integrate the different datasets, I will use BreedID to establish a relationship between the "Varieties" and "Images" tables. Each image will be associated with a specific breed through a foreign key relationship. By fetching data from the Dog API and populating the "Breeds" and "Images" tables, I was able to create a comprehensive database of dog breeds and their respective images. This database will allow me to query and retrieve information about specific varieties and display their associated images.
